# appy

A very basic knitting pattern generator for my design business. You drop in the information for the pattern, save it, and automagically get a PDF for your downloading pleasure.

PDFs are generated using Prawn. Built with Twitter Bootstrap because lazy.

The current version of this project only creates PDFs. Future versions will be more workbench-style and will have tech editing, test knitting, and drafting capabilities.

#### todo

- format pdf (this is always a todo)
- moar tests (always moar tests)
- validations on models (whoops...)
- math functions for sizing patterns?
- figure out how to work flat v. round because some patterns have both
- stitch counts for each row in form view and on PDF

#### workbench todo

- tech editing PDF annotation
- pattern drafting/note taking (???)
- *comments feature* admin users should be able to reply to comments (???)
- make sure that user permissions are consistent across app
